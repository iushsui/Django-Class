1. ORM stands for Object Relational Mapping.
2. It is a way of querying the database without having to write raw SQL queries.
3. Rather we can directly write python code to query the database.
4. Django has default support for ORM. We do not need to install extra package for this service.


Let's see basic CRUD ORMs.

Read:

1. If "ClassRoom" is the name of a model
    => ClassRoom.objects.all() this query is equivalent to "SELECT * FROM ClassRoom"
    => This gives us queryset
    => We can access the data from the queryset either by indexing or using loop

    
2. Filter
    classrooms = ClassRoom.objects.filter(address="Kathmandu")
    classrooms = ClassRoom.objects.filter(address="Kathmandu", name="Ten")

3. Get
    classroom = ClassRoom.objects.get(name="One")


Create:

# First Method
1. ClassRoom.objects.create(name="Ayush", address="Bhaktapur")

# Second Method/Another Way
2. c = ClassRoom(name="Ayush", address="Bhaktapur")
   c. save()
